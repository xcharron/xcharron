### Who I Am

I’m a builder, strategist, and product operator with a 25-year track record of launching companies, scaling platforms, and creating competitive advantage through story, structure, and software.

I’ve worn every hat from CEO and CMO to producer and founder — building from zero to millions across media, SaaS, hardware, and direct-to-consumer. Today, my focus is on the **intersection of AI, national security, and niche consumer software**.
